Software for cheap home automation of your reptile terrarium or any other
enclosed environment. With this software you are able to control for example a
terrarium so that the temperature and humidity is of a constant value.
Controlling the temperature can be done with heat lights, external heating or
cooling system. As long as there is one temperature sensor available the
software is able to keep a constant temperature.

For humidity control there is support for a spraying system. The sprayer can be
configured to spray for an X amount of seconds and there is a minimal period
between two spray actions. Use at least one humidity sensors to get a constant
humidity value. In order to lower the humidity you can add a dehumidifier.

The software is that flexible that there is no limit in amount of sensors, relay
boards or door sensors. The usage can be endless. All power switches have
support for timers to trigger based on a time pattern.

Running now stable for more than
[**10 years**](https://theyosh.github.io/TerrariumPI/posts/2024/08/01/10-year-anniversary/)!!!

If you are using this software for your animals or plants,
**[please post some pictures](https://github.com/theyosh/TerrariumPI/issues/210)**

Think off:

- Terrarium (wet or dry)
- Aquarium
- Tanks with animals or plants
- Greenhouse

And all this is controlled with a nice web interface with
[AdminLTE 3](https://adminlte.io/) based on Bootstrap 4 made interactive with
[Svelte 4](https://svelte.dev/).

## Installation

### Base

The installation expects a Pi with working network and ssh. It is tested with
[Raspberry Pi OS **Lite** 32bit](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/#raspberry-pi-os-32-bit).
Desktop images will **not** work. Installation seems to work, but it will not
work stable. So make sure you download the correct image for the Pi. \
It is possible to use USB or SSD drives to speed things up:
<https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/boot-raspberry-pi-4-usb>

### Docker

There is a Docker image which can be used instead of the source code. This
should make the installation a bit more easier. More information can be found
at:
[https://theyosh.github.io/TerrariumPI/install/#docker](https://theyosh.github.io/TerrariumPI/install/#docker)

You can skip the manual installation part.

### Manual

1. Get a working Raspberry Pi and login as user 'pi' \
   `ssh pi@[raspberry_ip]`
2. Install git \
   `sudo apt -y install git`
3. Clone this repository and submodules! \
   `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/theyosh/TerrariumPI.git`
4. Enter the new TerrariumPI folder \
   `cd TerrariumPI`
5. Run the installer script and wait \
   `sudo ./install.sh`
6. Reboot Raspberry PI to get all the needed modules loaded \
   `sudo reboot` (if done manual)

### Login

After either [docker](#docker) or [manual](#manual) installation, you should
have a web interface at <http://[raspberry_ip]>:8090 (login: **admin/password**)

All needed options and modules are setup by the installer script. This means
that I2C and 1Wire overlay are enabled by default.

Make sure that your Pi is secured when you put it to the Internet. Would be a
shame if TerrariumPI gets next victim of
'[A smart fish tank left a casino vulnerable to hackers](http://money.cnn.com/2017/07/19/technology/fish-tank-hack-darktrace/index.html)'
:P

## Updating

This updating is based on that the software is installed with the steps in the
Installation above. When updating between release versions it will take more
time due to database updates and cleanups. This can be seen in the log file.

### Docker

Stop the running container and pull the new image. Then you can start the
container again.

### Manual

1. Get a working Raspberry Pi and login as user 'pi' \
   `ssh pi@[raspberry_ip]`
2. Enter the TerrariumPI folder \
   `cd TerrariumPI`
3. Update the new code with git \
   `git pull`
4. Re-run the installation script in order to update software dependencies \
   `sudo ./install.sh`
5. Restart TerrariumPI: `sudo service terrariumpi restart`

Now **clear your browser cache** and reload the web interface. A brand new
version should be running.

## Hardware

This software requires a Raspberry Pi and some extra hardware in order to run
and work. The bare minimum and tested hardware is

- Raspberry PI with at least **4GB SD card** running
  [Raspberry Pi OS **Lite** 32bit](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/#raspberry-pi-os-32-bit).
  - Zero (Should work/At own risk/limited support)
  - [Zero 2W](https://github.com/theyosh/TerrariumPI/issues/823#issuecomment-1693236850)
    (Should work/At own risk/limited support)
  - Pi 2 (Should work/At own risk/limited support)
  - Pi 3 (Works/full support)
  - Pi 4 (Works/full support)
  - Pi 5 **does partly work** (At own risk/limited support. Due to changes in
    the hardware on the Pi PWM dimming is not working. And RPI cam is not
    supported)
- Power relay board
  - USB versions (Serial and Bitbang)
  - GPIO versions
  - PWM Dimmer versions
- Temperature/humidity/ultrasonic/PH sensors DHT11, DHT22, AM2303, DS1820,
  HIH4000, HC-SR04, SEN0161, etc through
  - OWFS
  - GPIO
  - 1 Wire interface
  - MCP3008 ([RasPiO Analog Zero](https://github.com/raspitv/analogzero))

[Full list of supported hardware](https://theyosh.github.io/TerrariumPI/hardware/)

### GPIO numbering

All hardware that connects to the GPIO pins use **Physical GPIO numbering** (1 -
40). The software will translate it to BCM if needed for a supported device or
sensor. [More information about GPIO pin numbering](https://pinout.xyz/)

For the analog devices use numbers of the channel on the analog device which is
from 0 to 7 (8 channels). Also the software expect the analog MCP3008 on GPIO
ports 19,21,23,24 physical (default).
[More information about GPIO pin numbering](https://pinout.xyz/)

### New hardware

If there is some other hardware which is not working with TerrariumPI, open an
issue on [Github](https://github.com/theyosh/TerrariumPI/issues) and we will try
to support it. We can only test it on a Raspberry PI 4.

## Remote data

It is possible to use external sensor data that is available through HTTP(S) in
JSON format. This way you can combine multiple Raspberry Pi's with TerrariumPI
running to one single system. By using multiple Raspberry PI's you can cover a
bigger area. But there are limitations.

Currently it is READONLY. So you can read out remote sensors and switches but
you cannot control the remote switches. But this way you can combine the power
switches total costs and power usage.
