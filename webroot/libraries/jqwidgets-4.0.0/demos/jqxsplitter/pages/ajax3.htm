ASP.NET is a web application framework developed and marketed by Microsoft to allow
programmers to build dynamic web sites, web applications and web services. It was
first released in January 2002 with version 1.0 of the .NET Framework, and is the
successor to Microsoft's Active Server Pages (ASP) technology. ASP.NET is built
on the Common Language Runtime (CLR), allowing programmers to write ASP.NET code
using any supported .NET language. The ASP.NET SOAP extension framework allows ASP.NET
components to process SOAP messages.
