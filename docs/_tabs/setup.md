Here you can find how you can setup various parts that works together as a
single enclosure. You can even setup multiple enclosures. But make sure that
relays and areas are not shared in multiple enclosures or areas.

A simple rule to remember:
> _A relay can only be used once_.

Unsplash key words
: Here you can enter key words to use for picking a random
background image.

## Weather

![Weather source form](/assets/img/Weather_Settings.webp) _Popup form
adding/updating the weather source_

With the weather data you can schedule your light system based on the **sun
rise** and **sun set**. This can either be at your home location, or any other
location. The sun rise and set times will be shifted to your home location
times. So when it is day at 08:00 at the given location, TerrariumPI will thread
that as 08:00 local time. This way, you can have seasons with shorter and longer
days, based on day of the year.

Other weather data is just for show. Does not have a function.

### API Change

As from October 2022 they changed the conditions to a free account. Which means
that we have fewer data to work with. This also means no history data for
climate mirroring out of the box. \
If you have created an account before that date, you should still be able to
use the One call API 2.5 which does hold all the needed information. With One
call API 3.0, you need an extra (free) subscription which needs credit card
data.

For everybody that is registered with OpenWeatherMap after October, will have
less data or you have to subscribe for the
[One call API 3.0](https://openweathermap.org/price)

**TerrariumPI will self test which API version you have. It will first test for
version 3.0 and if that fails, it will fallback to the (old free) 2.5 version.
So the API url for TerrariumPI is always as described below including the 2.5
in the url!**

### Setup

In order to use the weather system, you need to create a free account at
[OpenWeatherMap](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up).

Than use one of the two supported API urls: \
`https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=[City],[Country]&appid=[API_KEY]` \
or \
`https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?id=[CityID]&appid=[API_KEY]`

Do **not** add the `&metric=` part in the url. And keep the value of **2.5** in
the url!

TerrariumPI does about 6-10 calls on the One call API per day, what would result
in 300 calls max per month. And it can detect which API is available with your
OpenWeatherMap account.

**important** This OpenWeatherMap url will be encrypted in the database. So the
API_KEY value cannot be read out of the database directly.

Webcams
: One or more webcams that are used in this enclosure. Webcams selected
here can use the `archive light state` and `archive door state` option at the
[webcam settings](#webcams).

## Areas

Adding and changing areas is done here. But as areas have a but more
functionality, they are discussed per area type. The most important is that
there is an area configured as `main lights` as this will influence the timing
of other areas if they depend on the timing of the main lights. Without this,
the system will not work.

Also make sure that the light area has relays configured at the `Day settings`
tab.

Depending on the combination of `Type` and `Mode` some fields are disabled and
not used. The values that are shown will be ignored during the operating of the
software.

Three fields are always required and shared in all the area types:

Enclosure {% include required_input.html %}
: Select the enclosure to which this area belongs.

Type {% include required_input.html %}
: Select the type of area. Depending on the type, new/different options are
available.

Name {% include required_input.html %}
: The name of the area. Use an easy to remember name.

### Main Lights

![Area form](/assets/img/Area_Settings.webp) _Popup form for adding and updating
areas_

Mode {% include required_input.html %}
: Select the operating mode of this area. Use timer for custom on and off
times. Weather is using your [configured weather data](#weather)

Minimum hours
: Enter the minimum hours that the lights should be on. If the day
based on the weather data is shorter, the lights will stay on for at least this
amount of time.

Maximum hours
: Enter the maximum hours that the lights should be on. Reverse of
minimum hours.

Hours shift
: Shift the time that the lights should go on based on the weather
sun rise. Can be a positive or negative decimal value (ex: -1.3)

Main lights
: Toggle this if the lights are the main lights on the enclosure.
This is used for other areas that depend on this light area. **Make sure at
least one light area has the toggle main lights set**

Then you need to setup at least the `Day settings` tab else the software will
not work. Do not use the same relay in the day and night settings. That does not
work. A relay configured in the day settings part, will be off during the night
period.

In the day and night setting tab you can configure the following:

Begin time
: Depending on the selected **mode** you can enter the start time
when the relay(s) should go on.

End time
: Depending on the selected **mode** you can enter the end time when
the relay(s) should go off. The duration between begin and end time we call the
`operating window`

On duration
: Depending on the selected **mode** you can fine tune the time that
the relay(s) should on in **minutes** time. Enter a value of **0** to put the
relays on for the complete operating window time.

Off duration
: Depending on the selected **mode** you can enter the amount of
**minutes** the relay(s) should be off during the operating window. Enter **0**
to disable.

**Timer functionality:** When you have an operating window of 10 hours, and
selected 45 min on duration and 15 min off duration, you will get a that the
relays will toggle on at the start, run for 45 minutes, and go off for 15
minutes. As this is in total 1 hour, this will be repeated 10 times during the
operating window time.

Relays
: Here you select the relay(s) that needs to be controlled. When you
select a relay, depending on the type, you will get extra tabs where you can
either set the on/off dimming duration or relay delay when the relay(s) are
toggled on or off.

**Simulate sun rise/set**: When you select a dimmer and a normal relay, you
could setup the dimmer to go on in 30 minutes, and delay the normal relay for 30
minutes, so that when the dimmer is at full power, the other light is toggled
on. This will give a nice sun rise effect.

### Other areas

There are multiple types of areas that can be used. Almost all types have the
same logic, but the type of area is of influence on the used sensors. In the
screenshot below you see the `Humidity` type area. But for `CO2`,
`Conductivity`, `Cooling`, `Heating`, `Moisture`, `Fertility`, `PH` this is all
the same. Only `audio` and `watertank` are special areas which have their own
setup.

The system uses the sensors alarm values to determine the right conditions you
want. For example, using an area with a heater relay and temperature sensors
will try to get the temperature in the middle of the minimum and maximum sensor
values. Either by using a dimmer or by just toggling on and off. By changing the
sensor alarm values, you can raise or lower the wanted temperature. This is the
basic logic we use.

![Area form](/assets/img/Area_Settings_Type.webp) _Popup form for adding and
updating areas_

Depends on
: Here you can select other areas on which this area depends on. If
the depending area is in an alarm state, this area will not toggle on, or if
already on, toggle off. For example you have a water tank area and a humidity
area where you use a sprayer. When the water tank is (near) empty the low alarm
of the water tank will go on, and this humidity area will then not toggle on.
Protect against dry running the water sprayer.

Mode {% include required_input.html %}
: [Same as lights area](#main-lights)

Sensors
: Select the sensors you want to use with this type of area. The area
will use the average values of the current, min and max alarm values.

Day/night difference
: Enter a value that the sensors should raise or lower when it become night.
Enter a negative value for lowering the sensors. When it become day again, the
sensor values will go the opposite direction and return to normal. Leave it
**0** if you are planning to use the [variation tab](#variation)

Day/night source
: Select the day and night source. This can either be the main
lights or weather. This is used for light settings later on the day or night
tabs.

Next you can configure either the `Low alarm` or `High alarm` tab. This is
optional. When you do not select at least **1** relay in these tabs, you will
only get a summary for that area with no actions. The `Variation` tab is
[described separately](#variation).

**Make sure you do not select a relay more then once in these tabs and areas!**

Begin time
: Depending on the selected **mode** you can enter the start time
when the relay(s) should go on.

End time
: Depending on the selected **mode** you can enter the end time when
the relay(s) should go off. The duration between begin and end time we call the
`operating window`

On duration
: Here you can fine tune the time that the relay(s) should on in
**minutes** time. Enter a value of **0** to put the relays on for the complete
operating window time.

Off duration
: Here you can e enter the amount of **minutes** the relay(s)
should be off during the operating window. Enter **0** to disable.

Power on time
: Here you can even more fine tine the on duration. The value here
is in **seconds**. When this value is higher then **0** the relay will on for
this amount of seconds and will then toggle down.

Settle time
: The time between two relay actions. This is a value in
**seconds**. This means that when the relay goes off, it will wait this amount
of time before it will toggle on again. This value is also affective between the
`Low alarm` and `High alarm`.

Light status
: Select the state of the lights. If the light state is not in the
selected state here, the relays will **not** toggle and power down. This depends
on the option _Day/night source_ you have selected earlier.

Door status
: Select the state of the doors. If the door state is not in the
selected state here, the relays will **not** toggle and power down.

Alarm threshold
: The amount of errors that have to pass before the relays
toggles on.

Relays
: Select the relays that you want to use for this area. Make sure a relay
is **only used once**!

#### Variation

With the variation tab, you can fine tune the alarms of the sensors during the
day so that you can have for example different temperatures during the day. Or
you can even mirror a remote climate setting the **source** on
`Using current weather`.

![Area Variation tab](/assets/img/Area_Variation.webp) _Area variation tab_

Source
: Select the variation type. Depending on this option, some fields will
hide and other shows up.

Period/duration
: Depending on the source, you fill in a time or a duration in
minutes.

Value
: Depending on the source, the new value that should be set at the
selected time

External source url
: This is only available with the source option
`Use json source` and `Use script`

Offset
: This is only available with the source option `Using current weather`,
`Use json source` and `Use script`. This is a value that will be added to the
wanted current value.

### Audio

### Water tank

![Area Water tank form](/assets/img/Area_Watertank.webp) _Popup form for adding
and updating water tank areas_

The water tank area is a bit special. This can be used to measure your water
levels in a tank. This is done by using [HC-SR04 ultrasonic ranging sensor]({% link _hardware/hc-sr04_sensor.md %}).

Mode {% include required_input.html %}
: [Same as lights area](#main-lights)

Sensors
: Select the sensors you want to use with this type of area. Only
distance sensors can be used here.

Water volume {% include required_input.html %}
: Enter the total amount of water that the tank can hold in
**litres**

Height {% include required_input.html %}
: Enter the height of the water tank in **centimeters**

Offset {% include required_input.html %}
: Enter the distance between the sensor and the top of the water level in
**centimeters**

Other options are the same the other areas. You can use water pumps to fill your
water tank based on the alarm values.
