## Release 4.12.3 - Multiple bugfixes and maintenance updates

After 6 months we have a new release. This release is what later, as the
software is maturing. This results in less bugfixes and only updates for
external libraries. But this release does fix multiple small bugs.

### Bug fixes

#### Kasa relay loading

![Kasa icon](/assets/img/Kasa_Smart.webp){: .right width="200" }There where
multiple issues with [Kasa]({% link _hardware/tplinkkasa_relay.md %}) relays.
One issue was that loading the relay casus some strange timeouts during startup.
This would cause the interrupt the startup, and never bring the web gui online.
So leaving it in a reboot loop.

Another issue was with failing network connection during running TerrariumPI.
This is now also fixed in such a way, that it should see the error, and just try
again next time. It should not break the system any more.

#### Fixed hardware scanning timeouts

![Timer](/assets/img/timer.gif){: .right width="100" }Scanning for new sensors
will now be limited to 30 seconds. After that it will stop and continue the
normal process. This could cause also startup issues when scanning for new
sensors during startup, which did not respond correctly. And that will cause a
reboot loop and not able to login to TerrariumPI gui.

#### GPIO relays inverse

The inverse mode of GPIO relays is now handled at the GPIO library, so less code
and logic for TerrariumPI. Lets hope this will not cause issues during the
upgrade. This should be the final solution for GPIO relay controlling.

#### Fixed delayed relays

When you setup an area where the relay should be **shutdown** with a delay it
did not apply the delay. It was shutting down directly. Thanks to
[HTPProXy](https://github.com/HTPProXy) of finding it, and also finding the code
fix! Thanks!

#### Area variation

The area variation logic did not work well when entering time stamps. This has
been fixed by [HTPProXy](https://github.com/HTPProXy). It is not much used, but
with this fix it should be working like expected. And it seems to
[work very well](https://github.com/theyosh/TerrariumPI/issues/1009#issuecomment-2927648335).

### General updates

This release will also update all external libraries to the latest versions.

And the installer should be working better. Sometimes it did not use the Python
PiWheel library for installing extra software. Which would slow down the
installation a lot. Now it should work again.

Update the copy right year to 2025

### New translations

And thanks to other TerrariumPI users, the languages
[Dutch](https://weblate.theyosh.nl/projects/terrariumpi/-/nl/),
[English](https://weblate.theyosh.nl/projects/terrariumpi/-/en_GB/),
[German](https://weblate.theyosh.nl/projects/terrariumpi/-/de/) and
[Norwegian Bokmål](https://weblate.theyosh.nl/projects/terrariumpi/-/nb_NO/) are
updated. Thanks to all!
