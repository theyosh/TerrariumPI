## Release 4.12.5 - Summer release fix

With the new [Gauge graph
feature]({% link _posts/2025-08-07-release_4.12.4.md %}), we created a small
bug. So we had to fix that, and after some tinkering and remarks on the
<a href="#" id="matrix_link" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="TerrariumPI chat on Matrix">Matrix</a>
channel, we have re-designed the gauge graph value settings. You can now just
select which value you want to show on the gauge graphs.

Unfortunately there is no migration of the gauge settings values. So with this
release you have to re-select the values you want to show. Sorry
