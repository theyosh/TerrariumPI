## Release 4.13.0 - Lots of small updates makes a big release

With this release we have a lot of small fixes and some more noticeable. All
together it does make a rather big release.\
So here they are.

### New sensor AHTx0

![AHTx0 Sensor](/assets/img/ahtX0-sensor.webp){: .right width="200" }We now
support a new temperature and humidity sensor
[AHTx0]({% link _hardware/ahtx0_sensor.md %}). It is an I2C based sensor which
seams not that expansive but still cheap. Make sure you rerun the installer when
you have it manually installed. It needs new libraries to work.

### Refactoring Kasa hardware

In the past we only supported relays and light bulbs or light strips. Now we
should also be able to handle all other
[Kasa]({% link _hardware/tplinkkasa_relay.md %}) devices. Even dimmable lights
are now supported, but we do not support the dimming of the light (yet). Only on
and off actions should work.

### New language Slovakia

translated by [@misoteplan](https://github.com/misoteplan). Big thank you! 👍

### Update graphs

It is now possible to specify a default graph period other than a single day. So
you could now select a week period as a default for all your graphs. But be
careful, because if you have a lot of graphs on a single page, it can overwhelm
the database. So take care when you select a different period.

Another update is that we now have an hour period as well. That will show the
data of the last hour.

And on the dashboard the average graphs should not drop or spike at the last
minute when not all sensor data is available.

And there is an attempt to make the gauge graphs more responsive when you change
the alarm or limit values of a sensor.

### Bookworm updates

It turned out that the RPI webcam was not well working under Bookworm OS. This
is now fixed, and the Raspberry cam is not fully working again in Bookworm. For
both still image and live streaming.

Also it was possible to select a not supported white balancing, and that crashed
the RPI camera. And after changing it, only a restart of TerrariumPI would start
the camera again. This has been fixed that a webcam now is always restarted
after changing the settings. This should take care of failing RPI camera when
unsupported white balance is selected. This is only happening with Bookworm OS.

And after some other testing, it turns out that Bluetooth is probably not
working at all 🙁. We where at the moment unable to connect to a
[MiFlora]({% link _hardware/miflora_sensor.md %}) bluetooth sensor. The
bluetooth library as been reverted back to the original used and hopefully this
will not break anything. 🤞 \
A more detailed state of Bookworm OS support is in the making.
