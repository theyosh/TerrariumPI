## Release 4.0.0

After more then a year there is a new version. It took so much time as it is almost a complete rewrite. That was not planned, but it did happen.

The idea was to create a better REST API so that it would be easier to integrate. Unfortuanally that did not succeed, so we have lost about 6 months testing and createing all kinds of code. So for now, the API is changed, but the documentation is not. So that did not succeed.

But the biggest improvement is that we now can support multiple enclosures with mutliple areas. So that means that you do not need a Raspberry PI per enclosure anymore. And that you can have now two or three heating area's with their own configuration.
And the timing for the lights is updated and more clear how to setup.

So, go the [installation]({% link _tabs/install.md %}) page in order to install Terrarium PI version 4.
