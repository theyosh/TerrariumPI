## Release 4.3.3

This is again a small update which fixes some annoying bugs.

- Starting/stopping of MQTT servers should work now without a restart of TerrariumPI.
- Fixed total water cost indication. There was a calculation error on the dashboard.

[Get the new version here](https://github.com/theyosh/TerrariumPI/releases/tag/4.3.3).

So, go the [installation]({% link _tabs/install.md %}) page in order to install Terrarium PI version 4.
