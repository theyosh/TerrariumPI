## Release 4.14.0 - End of year release: Weather changes 🎄🎆

This release will bring some changes in the weather part of TerrariumPI. Thanks
to [@GamingLPyt](https://github.com/GamingLPyt) we have now support for
[OpenMeteo.com](#openmeteocom-weather-data) weather data.\
And that lead to a refactor the total weather code internally. Not something you
will notice on the outside... I hope 😁

Also fixed some RTSP and USB webcams on Bookworm.

### OpenMeteo.com weather data 🌤

![Logo OpenMeteo](/assets/img/OpenMeteo.com.svg){: .right.invert width="100"
}This is a [free service](https://open-meteo.com) which does not need an
account. You need to know the latitude and longitude of your location. And than
construct the following url below:

`https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=[LAT]&longitude=[LONG]`

More at the [weather documentation
page]({% link _tabs/setup.md %}#open-meteoorg)

### Other updates

- Updates all NodeJS, Python and Ruby libraries for the GUI, TerrariumPI and the
  documentation.
- Updated the documentation at various pages. Mostly adding more information or
  corrections.
