## Release 4.13.1 - Reconnect the dashboard / Bye bye `:latest`

![Broken cable image](/assets/img/broken-cable.webp){: .left width="180" }Due to
external package updates the websocket connection was broken on **Bookworm**
installations (both docker as manual). This resulted in an offline state in the
browser, and all the counters at the top of the dashboard at zero. No bueno...

So the websocket code is has been rewritten so it is working again. And the code
is now also more robust for the future.

### No more Docker `:latest`

![Docker logo](/assets/img/DockerLogo.webp){: .right width="200" }With version
4.13.0 there was no `:latest` image any more. This was not intentional, but
happened. And actually it is better. There are people mixing OS and container
versions. And even it does work, it makes it very hard to debug when things do
not work.

So now it is **official**. There is no more `:latest` tag for the [Docker
images]({% link _tabs/install.md %}#versions). This way, you have to pick a
specific version. Which makes it a bit easier to manage issues and support.

If for what reason you need to use the old `:latest` version, stick with
`:X-buster-java` version. But keep in mind: This is an old version, which is not
even supported anymore at all. It works as is...
