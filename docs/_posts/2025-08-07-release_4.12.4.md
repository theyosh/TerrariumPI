## Release 4.12.4 - Summer release, gauge updates and bug fixes

### New gauge graph settings

In this release we have a new 'feature'. You can now show the alarm values on
the gauge graphs [#1016](https://github.com/theyosh/TerrariumPI/issues/1016).
This makes it easier to read your gauge graphs and see how close you are to an
alarm value. \
You can find the setting on the settings page.

### Support for location ID in weather settings

It is now also possible to enter a [direct location
ID]({% link _tabs/setup.md %}#setup) from OpenWeatherMap.org. \
It can happen that a place name is not unique in a country. If that is the case
for you, you can now use a location ID so you can pick the correct city for
weather data. \
And updated the documentation as well about the usage of different API version.

### Extra relay toggling logging

And we added some logging when a relay is toggled. So we are now sure that the
relay is toggled when requested. Also this will make sure that you can see that
Terrariumpi is retrying to toggle the relay when it fails.

#### Bookworm live camera

Apparently some parameters used for live streaming in Bookworm was changed. This
should now be fixed again.

### General updates
