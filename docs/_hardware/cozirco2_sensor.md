## Information
The ExplorIR®-W is a small footprint low power CO₂ sensor designed for applications where space is at a premium. The combination of small size, low power and high accuracy makes this sensor suitable for portable, battery powered personal safety equipment.

The ExplorIR®-W has a very wide dynamic range and is capable of measuring CO₂ gas concentrations up to 100%, without compromising measurement accuracy or responsiveness.

The ExplorIR®-W uses patented NDIR solid-state LED optical technology that delivers consistent and accurate CO₂ measurement performance over the lifetime of the sensor.
