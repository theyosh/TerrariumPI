## Information

This simple door switch is based on a magnet and a reed switch. The magnet and the reed switch are both encased in ABS plastic with handy mounting holes. These sensors are commonly seen in consumer alarm systems and make an ideal addition to any Arduino or Raspberry Pi based alarm system.

The reed switch is simply a magnetic activated switch, as long as a magnet is close to it the reed switch will remain closed. Once the magnet is removed, the switch opens, breaking the circuit. The reed switch can handle a maximum of 100mA and a maximum of 200VDC.

Each half of the sensor can be mounted with screws or the included adhesive backing.
