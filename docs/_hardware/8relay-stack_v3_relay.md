## Information
Perfect add-on to your project when you have to control large number of loads. Stackable to 8 layers, the card can add up to 64 relays to each Raspberry Pi in a compact form factor.

Pluggable connectors make the 8-RELAYS card easy to use when multiple cards are stacked up. All relays have NO and NC contacts and can switch 120VAC/8A or 24VDC/8A.

Status LEDs conveniently grouped on one side of the board show when relays are on or off. A power LED shows when power is applied. A reset switch permits shutting down the Raspberry Pi without the use of a keyboard and monitor.
