## Information
The  Si7021  I2C Humidity  and  Temperature  Sensor  is  a  monolithic  CMOS  IC integrating   humidity   and   temperature   sensor   elements,   an   analog-to-digital converter, signal processing, calibration data, and an I2C Interface. The Si7021 offers an accurate, low-power, factory-calibrated digital solution ideal for measuring humidity, dew-point, and temperature, in applications ranging from HVAC/R and asset tracking to industrial and consumer platforms.

Features
- Precision Relative Humidity Sensor ± 3% RH (max), 0–80% RH
- High Accuracy Temperature Sensor ±0.4 °C (max), –10 to 85 °C
- 0 to 100% RH operating range
- Up to –40 to +125 °C operating range
- Wide operating voltage – (1.9 to 3.6 V)
- Low Power Consumption – 150 μA active current
